# project
For tictactoe_vue, I wanted to create a very simple bare bones tictactoe. You can just click onto index.html and it should work.

For the react projects, you need to go to project directory:
npm install
npm start
(this will start your local server)

For landingPage_vue, go into project directory, and do the following:
npm install
npm dev run
